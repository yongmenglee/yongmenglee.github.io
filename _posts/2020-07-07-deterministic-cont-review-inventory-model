## EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) Model: No Planned Shortages

Given that

$Q$ = order quantity, in unit
$K$ = setup cost per batch, in $
$c$ = unit cost, in $ per unit
$h$ = holding cost, in $ per unit per unit time
$d$ = ordering rate, in unit per unit time

The cycle length if $\frac{Q}{d} unit time.

Therefore, the production or ordering cost per cycle is $K + cQ$ in $.

Assume that the average inventory level during a cycle is $\frac{Q+0}{2} = \frac{Q}{2}$ units, and its corresponding holding cost is $\frac{hQ}{2}$ in $ per unit time.

Therefore, the holding cost per cycle is, in $,

$$
\frac{hQ}{2} \times \{Q}{d} = \frac{hQ^2}{2d}
$$

Then, the total cost per cycle is, in $, $K + cQ + \frac{hQ^2}{2d}$

We denote by $T$, the total cost (in $) per unit time, as follows:

$$
T = \left( K + cQ + \frac{hQ^2}{2d} \right) \times \frac{1}{Q/d}
= \frac{dK}{Q} + cd + \frac{hQ}{2}
$$
