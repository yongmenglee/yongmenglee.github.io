## A Quadratic Equation Raised to the Power of A Quadratic Equation

Imagine this, there is a quadratic equation raised to the power of another quadratic equation. You might think, what on earth is this? It must be very insane! How can we solve this kind of equation?

Well, believe it or not? The trick is indeed very easy.

Without further ado, here is the equation:

$$
\left( x^2 - 7x + 11 \right)^{(x^2 - 13x + 42)} = 1
$$

*So, where should I start from?*

## Step 1: $x^0 = 1$
