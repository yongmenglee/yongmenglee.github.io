## A Quadratic Equation Raised to the Power of A Quadratic Equation

Imagine this, there is a quadratic equation raised to the power of another quadratic equation. You might think, what on earth is this? It must be very insane! How can we solve this kind of equation?

Well, believe it or not? The trick is indeed very easy.

Without further ado, here is the equation:

$$
\left( x^2 - 7x + 11 \right)^{(x^2 - 13x + 42)} = 1
$$

The goal is to find the value of $x$ which satisfies the equation above.

*Okay, fine. Now, where should I start from?*

## Case 1: $a^0 = 1$

This is a very fundamental concept in high school mathematics. It should look familiar: any number raised to the power of $0$ equals to $1$. Looking back at our equation, we can quickly recognize that the value on the right hand side is $1$. Therefore, we make the following assumptions:

$$
\begin{align}
a &= x^2 - 7x + 11
\\
0 &= x^2 - 13x + 42 \label{eq:power0}
\end{align}
$$

And guess what? We can solve $\eqref{eq:power0}$ right away! ðŸ˜€

Let's move on...

$$
\begin{align}
x^2 - 13x + 42 &= 0 \notag
\\
(x - 6)(x - 7) &= 0 \notag
\\
x &= 6, 7
\end{align}
$$

Good start! We have obtained our first two values of $x$.

**But, wait! These are only the first two values of $x$! Then, what's next?**

## Case 2: $1^b = 1$
